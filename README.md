The Titanic Dataset Analysis explores passenger survival patterns from the tragic 1912 Rms Titanic disaster 

The Titanic Dataset Analysis explores passenger survival patterns from the tragic 1912 Titanic disaster. Using data analytics and visualisation techniques, the analysis examines key factors influencing survival rates, such as passenger class, age, gender, fare, and embarkation point. Statistical methods, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and Machine Learning models are applied to uncover insights and predict survival probabilities. This study highlights the impact of socio-economic status and demographics on survival outcomes, offering valuable insights into historical data interpretation and predictive modelling.
Various procedures for pre-processing the data will be followed, a few interetsing EDA techniques.
